==================================
Build for custom board (ZYNQ 7020)
==================================

Overview
========

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a digital system using custom hardware designs and software integration. It is intended for developers working with Xilinx platforms and hardware acceleration environments.

Features
========

- Integration with a custom Xilinx hardware design (.xsa)
- Modular and extensible design
- Ready for deployment with your own XSA file

Requirements
============

- Xilinx Vitis or Vivado toolchain (depending on the project)
- Python 3.x (if applicable)
- Linux environment (recommended)
- Hardware platform compatible with your custom XSA

Installation
============

1. Clone this repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ShoaibAhmad123/custom-zynq-7020.git
      cd custom-zynq-7020

2. Place your own custom `.xsa` file in the project directory.

   .. note::

      The original `.xsa` file has been removed as it contains proprietary content. You must supply your own custom XSA for this project to function correctly.

3. Build or configure the project as per your environment.

Usage
=====

Modify scripts and configurations to use your `.xsa` file. Follow the standard build and deployment process using Vitis/Vivado or other supported toolchains.

Disclaimer
==========

This project does not include the original `.xsa` file due to proprietary restrictions. Users are required to use their own custom hardware specification archives.
